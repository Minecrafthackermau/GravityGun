# Gravity Gun
3D FPS shooter with gravity and anti-gravity "bullets".

## Gameplay  
A project to test how to invert gravity and ended up with a fun little shooter game. You can shoot bullets on the dark grey objects and the bullets should stick to them (some bugs may interfere) and lower or increase (left or right mouse button) the objects gravity value. You can also shoot some kind of wind gust. There is not goal in this game, just have fun! Try get on top of a platform and shoot anti-gravity bullets and see if you can take off in the air.


## Controls 
  - Move – W, A, S, D 
  - Jump – Space 
  - Run – Hold shift 
  - Shoot Anti-gravity bullets – Left Mouse button 
  - Shoot gravity bullets – Right Mouse button 
  - Wind Gust – F-key  

## Notes 
  - This is game is a work in progress and you may experience bugs!  
  - Wind gust is not meant to be visible as you are "shooting wind", it's just for a visual representation under development to know where the gust is. 
  - I do not own the rights for the model and sound and sound effects
